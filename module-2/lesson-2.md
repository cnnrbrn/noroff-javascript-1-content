## Events

When something happens in the browser, like a page loads, a form is submitted or a user clicks a button, the DOM sends an `Event`.

We can write code to respond to an event 

Some examples of events include:

- `click` - when the mouse button is clicked
- `keydown` - when any key is pressed
- `keyup` - when any key is released
- `mouseover` - when the mouse cursor moves over a DOM element or its children elements
- `mouseout` - when the mouse cursor moves off an element  
- `submit` - when a form is submitted

You can find a full list of events [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events).

An event is an object with properties.
