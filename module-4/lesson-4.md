Looping through arrays of objects is important because that's how lists of results get returned from API calls.

---

Loop through the array below (with a `for` loop or a `forEach` loop) and log each property's age value. Log `"Unknown"` if it is missing.

```js
const cars = [
    {
        type: "BMW",
        age: 4,
        beenInAccident: false
    },
    {
        type: "Toyota",
        beenInAccident: true
    },
    {
        type: "Ford",
        beenInAccident: true
    }
];
```
